Hi! I'm Frank Xiao, a sophmore at Caltech studying Computer Science. I'm currently a memeber of the Professor Pietro Perona's [Vision Lab] (https://www.vision.caltech.edu/).

My current research interests lies in the theory and applications of image generation models, particularly **diffusion** and **flow-based** models. For instance, I've worked on using diffusion models to generate images that consistently fool state of the art face recognition models. I'm also interested in vision and vision related applications, having built a fully automated UAV swarm solution for fracture mapping in collaboration with the (USGS) [https://www.usgs.gov/] and building the current state of the art signature verification system.
